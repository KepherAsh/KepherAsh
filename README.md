## 🚀 About Me 
I am a data analyst who helps organizations make better decisions by turning complex data into clear, actionable insight. My strength lies in bridging the gap between raw data and business strategy, ensuring leaders have the clarity they need to act with confidence.
My work centers on building practical, user-driven dashboards, automating repetitive processes to improve efficiency, and developing analytical models that support planning and strategic growth. I prioritize solutions that are not only technically sound but also adopted and trusted by stakeholders.
